Summary:
This script combines two separate data sets. 
These data were evaluted to determine correlations between school characterstics (size, budget, tyep...etc) and student academic performance.

Conclusions:
1. Charter schools tend to have higher passing rates than district schools.
2. Schools with smaller per student budgets tend to have higher test scores.
3. There seems to be no direct correlation between school size and academic performance.
